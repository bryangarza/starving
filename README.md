#Starving

##Motivation
The github.com mobile view is really bad, there's no way to view your
stars unless you go to desktop mode. Every time I want to show someone
a cool repo I found, it takes me forever to dig through and find
anything.

##Solution
Create a better mobile experience to browse your github stars.
